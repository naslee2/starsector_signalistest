signalis_buyan_planet,CUSTOM,"A toxic planet that was once the capital of the original rulers of the star system headquartered in a massive palace held up above the corrosive clouds by antigravity units. For decades they held out against the revolutionary forces who slowly wore them down until the final battle destroyed the palace. Now its just another planet with resources ripe for exploitation.	",,,
signalis_vineta_planet,CUSTOM,"The crowning glory of a long gone terraforming cabal. Vineta was home to hundreds of millions in its prime with vast cities and skyscrapers that touched the sun. When the Revolution reached Vineta, it became the site of numerous battles both on and above the planet with both sides attempting to wrest the planet from the other's hand. Decades of colonial mismanagment, war and intentional planetary destruction have drowned the planet in water. With all the major cities drowned in one way or another, the last remaining habital areas are overcrowded. ",,,
signalis_shattered_moon,CUSTOM,"Cracked decades ago by a powerful weapon, the moon hangs dead above Vineta. Once teeming with mining operations, manufacturing sites and habitation stations the moon now hangs above Vineta, silent and dead.",,,
signalis_kitezh_planet,CUSTOM,"Colonized around the same time as Vineta, Kitezh was given the same terraforming treatment but was never able to fully replicate the same conditions produced on Vineta. However conditions were good enough for farming and mining and Kitezh became the known for its foodstuffs and natural resources. The war between the revolutionaries and old rulers have damaged the fragile ecosystem and the once productive farmland now outputs a fraction of previous eras. ",,,
signalis_gas_giant1_planet,CUSTOM,"A massive gas giant who's main defining feature is a giant, crimson colored anti-cyclonic storm system in the high pressure regions. Known as the ""Red Eye"" and it is subject to many folk lores on Rotfront. For many on Rotfront the Red Eye's unblinking, penetrating stare is often likened to the pervasive survellance and hardships experienced by the colonists of Rotfront. Every year the citizens of Rotfront celebrate Mondfest where students are gifted red-painted coins. Officially it symbolizes the blood spilled by the original revolutionaries but some have remarked it just colored to make the coins look more like the ""Red Eye"". ",,,
signalis_gas_giant2_planet,CUSTOM,"A massive gas giant known for its very distintive rings. Scientists theorized several million years ago an icy moon broke apart by some unknown event, creating the ice rings that this gas giant is so famous for. Nearby Heimat often send ice mining ships to harvest the ice as well as capture some of the miniture moons known for their ice content. For those living on Heimat, the mining ships are a source of life, complementing the existing water sources pumped from below the planet. Despite this, water rationing is strictly enforced for the average citizen with only those who are part of the Nation's ruling party being alotted a signficant increase of water rations while the inner circle of the Nation's goverment having access to unlimited supply of fresh water.",,,
signalis_rotfront_planet,CUSTOM,"Rotfront is the main colonial effort by the Nation to ensure the people of Eusa have a place to call a home. With Vineta's remaining landmass overcrowded and under heavy pressure to support human life, the Nation has elected to move a large portion of colonists to Rotfront. Limited and crude terraforming by the Nation have improved its habitability by a very small percentage. Large cities have cropped up in the cold expanse of Rotfront with infrastructure to support a growing population. The constant rain, slurry and cold temperatures on Rotfront have not helped make life easier for the colonists, already having to contend with pervasive survellance and intimindation by the local Protecktor units.",,,
signalis_heimat_planet,CUSTOM,"Once a mining, refining and heavy industry planet, a workers uprising culiminated with the rise of the Nation, led by the Great Revolutionary and her Daughter. After successfully overthrowing the previous colonial government, the revolitionaries establised their new Nation on Heimat, expanding its infrastructure to become the central focus of its ""liberation war"". Since ",,,
signalis_leng_planet,CUSTOM,"The outermost planet of the system and the furtherest inhabited colony of the Nation. Leng's natural resources and remotness have made it a prime canidate for colonial expansion both willing and unwilling. For those who committed crimes against the Nation or simply judged problematic, there is a place to redeem themselves and to do their duty to the Nation as productive citizens. ",,,
