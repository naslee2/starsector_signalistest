signalis_buyan_planet,CUSTOM,"A toxic planet that was once the capital of the original rulers of the star system headquartered in a massive opulant palace held up above the corrosive clouds by antigravity units. When the uprisings in Heimat began, the main coordination for the Imperial response was directed from the Imperial Palace. As the war progressed the Palace was expanded to include military defenses, manufacturing, shipbuilding and repair. For decades they held out against the revolutionary forces who slowly wore them down until the final battle destroyed the palace and killed the Last Empress. Now its just another planet with resources ripe for exploitation.",,,
signalis_vineta_planet,CUSTOM,"The crowning glory of a long gone terraforming cabal. Vineta in its prime had a population in the several hundred millions with vast cities and skyscrapers that touched the sun. When the Revolution reached Vineta, it became the site of numerous battles both on and above the planet with both sides attempting to wrest the planet from the other's control. Decades of war and intentional planetary destruction have drowned the planet in water. With all the major cities destroyed or flooded, the last remaining habitable areas are badly overcrowded. To ease the resource strain and improve logistics, the Nation have begun relocating Vinetans to Rotfront.",,,
signalis_shattered_moon,CUSTOM,"Cracked decades ago by a powerful Imperial weapon, the moon hangs dead above Vineta. Once teeming with mining operations, manufacturing sites, research labs and habitation stations the murdered moon now hangs silent above Vineta. Recovery and salvage expeditions are discouraged by the Nation due to the sheer amount of debris surrounding the moon.",,,
signalis_kitezh_planet,CUSTOM,"Colonized around the same time as Vineta, Kitezh was given the same terraforming treatment but was never able to fully replicate the same conditions produced on Vineta. Conditions were barely considered good enough for farming and mining but despite this, Kitezh later became well known for its vast industrial farms. The war between the Nation and Empire have damaged the fragile ecosystem and the once productive farmland now outputs a fraction of previous eras. Farmers now have to deal with deadly sandstorms, increased encroachment of the red desert sands and the uncompromising output quotas demanded by the Nation.",,,
signalis_gas_giant1_planet,CUSTOM,"A massive gas giant who's main defining feature is a giant, crimson colored anti-cyclonic storm system in the high pressure regions. Known as the 'Red Eye', it is subject to many folk lores. For many on Rotfront the Red Eye's unblinking, penetrating stare is often likened to the pervasive survellance and hardships experienced by the colonists of Rotfront. Every year the citizens of Rotfront celebrate Mondfest where students are gifted red-painted coins. Officially it symbolizes the blood spilled by the original revolutionaries but some have remarked it just colored to make the coins look more like the 'Red Eye'. Local authorities have tried to stamp this out unsuccessfully and some administrators are content to letting it slide, much to the fustration of Heimat's far away rulers.",,,
signalis_gas_giant2_planet,CUSTOM,"A massive gas giant known for its very distintive rings. Scientists theorized several million years ago an icy moon broke apart by some unknown event, creating the ice rings that this gas giant is so famous for. Nearby Heimat often send ice mining ships to harvest the ice as well as capture some of the miniture moons known for their ice content. For those living on Heimat, the mining ships are a source of life, complementing the existing water sources pumped from below the planet. Despite this, water rationing is strictly enforced for the average citizen with only those who are part of the Nation's ruling party being alotted a signficant increase of water rations while the inner circle of the Nation's goverment having access to unlimited supply of fresh water.",,,
signalis_rotfront_planet,CUSTOM,"Rotfront is the main colonial effort by the Nation to ensure the people of Eusa have a place to call a home. With Vineta's remaining landmass overcrowded and under heavy pressure to support human life, the Nation has elected to move a large portion of colonists to Rotfront. Limited and crude terraforming by the Nation have improved its habitability by a small percentage. Large cities have cropped up in the cold expanse of Rotfront with infrastructure to support a growing population. The constant rain, slurry and cold temperatures on Rotfront have not helped make life easier for the colonists, already having to contend with pervasive survellance and intimindation by the local Protecktor units.",,,
signalis_heimat_planet,CUSTOM,"Once a minor mining planet, a worker uprising culiminated with the rise of a new Revolutionary goverment, led by the Great Revolutionary and her Daughter. After successfully overthrowing the local colonial government, the revolutionaries establised the newly created Eusan Nation's captial on Heimat. The Nation then expanded its infrastructure to become the central focus of its 'liberation war', becoming its primary weapons production, shipbuilding and military command hub. Since the end of the War it has become the primary capital world of the star system. Everything that happens, ever decision, every move made by the Nation is deliberated, planned and executed in Heimat.",,,
signalis_leng_planet,CUSTOM,"The outermost planet of the system and the furtherest inhabited colony of the Nation. Leng's natural resources and remotness have made it a prime canidate for colonial expansion for both willing and unwilling citizens of the Nation. For those who committed crimes against the Nation or simply judged problematic, there is a place to redeem themselves and to do their duty to the Nation as productive citizens. The ""Arbeits und Erziehungsorgan der Nation's"" (AEON) S-23 Sierpinski Mining Facility is the most infamous of these work facilities being well known for harsh conditions and uncompromising vigilance of its Replika Protecktor units.",,,
signalis_wrecked_station,CUSTOM,"An orbital station built during the colonial era as part of a series of transfer and storage points for terraforming Vineta. When the Empire arose, the station was rebuilt to address its age and convert it to more trade oriented aspects. During the war between the Nation and Empire, the station changed hands multiple times, seeing brutal hand to hand fighting. After the moon was shattered from an Imperial strike, the station suffered severe damage from debris from the moon and abandoned. Now its damaged hulk orbits around Vineta.",,,,
